# 🚀 Spaceship Flight Analysis Project

## 📖 Introduction
This project is part of the **"Programmieren I"** course and is centered around analyzing and visualizing the flight path of a spaceship based on data from a provided `.csv` file. The project involves processing time-step data, calculating various metrics, and generating visualizations to understand the spaceship's movement and the measured temperatures.

### Key Features:
- **Input:** A `.csv` file containing acceleration, rotation, and temperature data over 100 time steps.
- **Output:** Calculated metrics, visualizations, and optional reports in various formats.

## ✅ Minimum Grading Criteria Checklist
To secure a positive grade, the following tasks are implemented:

- [x] **Read Data**: Parse the `.csv` file to extract spaceship instructions and measurements.
- [x] **Max Speed**: Calculate the maximum velocity achieved during the flight.
- [x] **Output CSV**: Generate a `.csv` file containing the spaceship's position and orientation at each time step.
- [x] **Max Distance**: Determine the maximum distance from the starting position during the flight.
- [x] **Total Path Length**: Calculate the total distance traveled.
- [x] **Temperature Stats**: Compute the following temperature metrics:
  - Maximum
  - Minimum
  - Average
  - Variance
